Find the sum of the first n odd integers
(e.g. if n=4): 1+3+5+7=16

[HINT]: You'll need to solve a small mathematical derivation to pass the crash test ;)
Input
A positive integer n
Output
The sum of the first n odd integers
(e.g. if n=4): 1+3+5+7=16
Constraints
None, but your program must be optimized enough to pass all the test cases!

JavaScript: You might fail the last 'Mega Crash Test' due to the 16-character limit, but it's only a Validation so you don't need to pass it (as long as you pass the first crash test you are fine).

C++: Just a small clarification: the answer fits in a 64-bit number!
Example
Input
4
Output
16
